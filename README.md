# election-analysis
Python Project

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
After a successful election audit the election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit including:
The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout

I need to enhance my code to be able to out the requested data using the same data given.

## Analysis and Challenges

Reorganizing the data to calculate the requested county information is pretty straight forward.  The challange was formatting and printing it to text in the waythe commission expects.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be incredibly useful in the audits of future elections.  It is designed to be able to handle large amonuts of data points.  With small modifications in the intake of candidate names and output format it can easily be used to for:
1. An entire state's congressional election
2. Govenoral elections

With a few more additonal fields it can even be used to measure polling.
